# ðŸš¦ OKRs

At Flexpa, our mission is to refactor healthcare by connecting applications to identified claims data. We recognize the significance of setting clear goals and tracking progress to achieve remarkable results.

We rely on OKRs, or Objectives and Key Results, as a simple yet powerful tool for goal-setting, alignment, and performance tracking within our organization. While we acknowledge many companies have instituted OKRs, we at Flexpa have set up a particular process that works for our team at our size. 

## Why have OKRs?
We adopted OKRs early on, recognizing the importance of everyone understanding our top priorities and how to measure our impact. We set OKRs at the company and team levels, consistently reviewing our progress and learning from challenges. OKRs serve as a catalyst for meaningful conversations, valuable feedback, and recognition within our teams, enhancing both performance and our company culture. We firmly believe that OKRs, along with regular progress tracking and check-ins, are key factors in our success, and we constantly strive to leverage them even better.

By utilizing OKRs, we effectively communicate our vision and strategy, focus on our customers' needs, and establish a culture of transparency and accountability. OKRs motivate us to exceed our own expectations and achieve outstanding outcomes.

## OKRs at Flexpa
At Flexpa, we believe that OKRs are not used as a tool to track individual performance but rather as a means to align collective efforts, foster cross-functional collaboration, and drive organizational success. OKRs are the sole mechanism used to plan work for the quarter at Flexpa. They are collaboratively defined with avenues to contribute towards a goal from every Flexpa team member. Our Product Roadmap serves as a reflection of the quarterâ€™s work towards OKRs as well as a projection of potential future priorities. 

Objectives represent the outcomes we strive to achieve, embodying the "Whats" of our journey. Key Results outline the measurable steps that pave the way, serving as the tangible "Hows" toward realizing those objectives. Objectives are qualitative and aligned with our mission of refactoring healthcare, while key results are quantitative, specific, and time-bound. We have a single top-level (Level 1) objective to maintain goal alignment, and no more than five key results (Level 2 Objectives) to maintain focus.

## Owning OKRs
Each L1 Objective and its corresponding L2 Objectives are assigned a dedicated Flexpal as an Owner. The overall OKR process each quarter is supervised by the owner of the company level Objective. The Owner is not solely responsible for the success of the Objective or Key Result. At Flexpa, we embrace a collaborative approach, and any Flexpal, regardless of their title or role, has the opportunity to be an Owner and contribute to the achievement of the OKRs. 

### L1 owners are responsible for:
* **Process ownership:** The L1 O owner closely monitors OKR progress through the L2 O ownersâ€™ weekly updates. The L1 O owner conducts bi-weekly check-ins with Flexpaâ€™s OKR coach to provide teams and individuals with valuable feedback on progress and refine our approach to the process. 
* **Product leadership:** The L1 O owner needs to maintain understanding of each L2â€™s surface area. They need to lead L2 Owners towards making changes but need to be empowered to affect change directly as necessary. 

### L2 owners are responsible for:
* **Driving progress and results:** Owners should be planning out milestones and issues in Linear that map out the quarterâ€™s tasks with as much fidelity as is reasonable at any given time. The teammates they rely on should be aware of their dependencies to prioritize individual work accordingly. 
* **Reassessing goals:** Based on progress through the quarter, owners should be constantly reassessing whether we are pointed at the right target. 

## Setting OKRs
When establishing OKRs, we adopt a scientific approach to avoid setting unattainable goals, where achieving a perfect score seems impossible or unrealistic. OKRs are not static mandates. We evaluate our OKRs to ensure they align with the most important work at Flexpa and adjust them throughout the quarter if necessary. OKRs are scored, and new ones are agreed upon at our quarterly in-person retreat, fostering reflection, alignment, and goal setting.

## Tracking OKRs
Within the first two weeks of a quarter, all L2 O owners should draft a written report outlining the tasks they plan to accomplish and accompanying target completion dates for each task. This document provides the company level Objective owner with context into the quarterâ€™s plan and allows them to rapidly triage or ask follow up questions where necessary.

L2 owners will report weekly on OKR progress via a written update on Linear, and Loom recordings that are sent to our dedicated Slack channel. We use a color coded system to indicate progress and capacity during these check-ins (see below for details).

## Scoring OKRs
At Flexpa, OKRs are scored using [bankers rounding](https://wiki.c2.com/?BankersRounding) to round quantities to integers. The scoring framework ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where "0" represents failure and "1.0" indicates complete achievement of the objective. Each key result is graded within this framework, and the average score is used to determine the objective's overall score. The scoring system at Flexpa follows these guidelines:

* **ðŸ”´ 0.0 to 0.3:** Red
  * At weekly reporting, this indicates the KR is at risk. We may need significant changes to the goal or resourcing, or we may need to rewrite it altogether.
  * At the end of the quarter, this indicates that real progress was not made.
* **ðŸŸ¡ 0.4 to 0.6:** Yellow
  * At weekly reporting, this indicates the KR needs attention. We may need to look at different tactics to accomplish this, reduce the goal, or get more resources.
  * At the end of the quarter, this represents progress made but falling short of completion. 
* **ðŸŸ¢ 0.7 to 1.0:** Green
  * At weekly reporting, this indicates the KR is on track. With current progress, we anticipate to reach a green at the end of this quarter.
  * At the end of the quarter, this signifies successful delivery and achievement of the objective.

We pair the quarterly OKR scores with qualitative learnings as well. These consist of the ownerâ€™s takeaways on anything from OKR construction, to reflections on size of the task, to learnings from the work completed.
