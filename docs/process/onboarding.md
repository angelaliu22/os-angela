# üõ¨ Onboarding

## Philosophy

At Flexpa, we believe that a successful onboarding is the foundation for the rest of our time working together. Our goal is to ensure that within 90 days, anyone who joins will be fully integrated into our team, culture, and work, to the point where they would be truly missed if they left.

The foundation for a successful onboarding is a written plan - an onboarding guide - that is given to the new Flexpal on their first day. This guide should be a living document that is updated and improved over time. It should be a comprehensive resource that covers everything the new Flexpal needs to know to be successful in their role.

## How to write an onboarding guide

### Principles

1. **Be direct and honest from the start**: We value direct communication and feedback. New Flexpals should feel comfortable both receiving and providing candid feedback.
2. **Encourage productive disagreement**: We want everyone to disagree productively, offering solutions and alternatives rather than just objections.
3. **Make work visible**: New Flexpals should communicate their work and progress clearly, ensuring everyone understands the purpose and value of their tasks. No one should wonder if things are working out or not. It should be obvious. This principle is especially important for us as a [remote first team](../remote-first)
4. **Understand our product and customers**: It's crucial for all Flexpals to deeply understand our product, use cases, and the problems our customers face.

### Essential Sections

1. **Welcome and mission**: A welcome message from the hiring manager that sets the tone for the new Flexpal's onboarding experience and outlines the first mission of anyone new: onboarding successfully.
2. **Week 1 Agenda**: A detailed day-by-day schedule for the new Flexpal's first week, including meetings, introductions, and tasks to complete. All week-one agenda's must include:

    - A day 1 welcome, identity and access control setup
    - Team introduction
    - Introductions to Product, Design, and GTM
    - 1:1s with everyone on the team - these sessions should focus on getting to know each other and understanding what each person does on the team
    - 1:1 with the hiring manager where the recurring [1:1](./1-1s) format is introduced
    - An end of week 1:1 with Andrew

3. **30/60/90 Day Plan**: Outlines expectations and milestones for the new Flexpal's first 90 days, broken down into three phases:

    - Phase I [Day 0-30]: Become knowledgeable. Adapt to the team and culture. Understand how we work and why. Soak in context.
    - Phase II [Day 30-60]: Become productive. Take on more direct responsibilities of the role. Ship, ship, ship.
    - Phase III [Day 60-90]: Become indispensable. Contribute to Flexpa's growth and success. If they left, we would miss them.

4. **Why We Hired You**: Shares the team's decision-making process and feedback from the hiring process to boost the new Flexpal's confidence and understanding of how they fit into the team. This is our opportunity to practice being direct. You should provide not just the specific reasons, but the literal, direct feedback collected from the team during the interview process.
5. **Reference Checks**: Includes detailed notes from reference checks conducted by the hiring manager, providing additional context on the new Flexpal's strengths, working style, and areas for growth. Lots of companies never do this.

## Example Onboarding guide

_This example is example of a guide we've developer for a software developer / software engineer. You should always ensure this is role specific_.

### Welcome and mission

**Your very first mission is to onboard successfully**. The ultimate test of a successful onboarding means that in 90 days from now, people would truly miss you if you left.

**There are some common onboarding failure points that you should know about**. Knowing these in advance will help you avoid them.

- Being uncomfortable with receiving or providing direct feedback. We are a small team on a small boat. We will be direct with you, and we need you to be direct with us. (See üçí Cherry Pickers)
- Being unable to disagree productively. Failure here either means avoidance of disagreement entirely or of disagreeing without offering any solutions. (See üëø Counter Productive Contrarians)
- Not making your work visible and being unable to communicate about why something needs to be done. Use your standups to be visible! Do them first thing in the morning and make sure you understand why you‚Äôre doing something first so that you can tell everyone else. (See üöß Barrier Builders)
- Not getting to know Flexpa‚Äôs product, use case, and our customer‚Äôs problems. It‚Äôs all too easy to solve problems that don‚Äôt really matter or to simply avoid really getting to know the problems we are trying to solve. This is especially true for developers (there‚Äôs always another CSS fix around the corner). (See üßõ Runway Vampires)

**There are, likewise, some common onboarding indicators of success**. You should aim for these.

- Ship early and ship often. If an issue is just too hard, don‚Äôt worry about it ‚Äì communicate, ask for help. We will help you ship, but you‚Äôve got to create the momentum (See üèÉ Momentum Makers)
- Fix problems you see along the way. If there‚Äôs something broken in the README or onboarding docs, fix it. Show that you take pride in your work. (See üõí Put the Shopping Cart Back)
- Absorb, listen to, and interact with customers as much as possible. Listen to every GTM call you can, read every Slack support message as much as possible, and soak it in. Write summaries of calls you listen to, share them, and ask questions. Improve our collective understanding. Really try to understand the problems we are trying to solve. (See ‚ù§Ô∏è Empathy Experts)

**Your onboarding buddy is X**. You‚Äôll get a chance to meet each other on Wednesday. She will act as your first line of support over the first two weeks.

**What does success look like at the end?** In 90 days you are fully up to speed on Flexpa product, GTM, culture, tools, and team. You are responsible for making momentum and shipping meaningful contributions that move the needle on the KPIs the company sets during its quarterly retreats.

    - Ship and solve at least one issue a week
