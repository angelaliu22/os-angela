# 🪐 Operating System
![Flexpa brand avatars](./assets/Illustration-hero.png)


This is [Flexpa's](https://flexpa.com) operating system.

We have written down how we work, what we value, and how we make decisions. The process for changing this system is the same as changing code.

This operating system exists because Flexpa is a text culture company.

Text culture is a culture where we write things down.

> We write things down so that we can share them. We write things down so that we can refer to them later. We write things down so that we can change them. We write things down so that we can improve them. We write things down so that we can make them better. We write things down so that we can make them better together.
